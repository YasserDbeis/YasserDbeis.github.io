            <p> Product Engineering Intern at Life365: <br>
              I simplified device configuration with custom Android software helping save nearly 30 minutes of labor per device. <br>
              Also, I supported the reduction of offline/missing tablets to 0% through restructuring of device configuration procedure<br>
              and installation scripts. I served as Interim CTO, leading efforts in troubleshooting product malfunction for a substantial<br>
              client in a time-sensitive fashion and organized and played a key role in meetings with C-suite co-workers to adjust the <br>
              technological direction of the company.
            </p>
            <p> Research Assistant at The Imaging Lyceum Lab  <br>
              I am currently assisting in the advancement of research in “lensless” camera technologies. The current technologies making <br>
              this possible are deep learning and machine learning. So far I have been able to make an adjustable diffuser support that allows <br>
              for dynamic capture of psfs.
            </p>
            <p> Banana Republic Brand Ambassador (Sales Associate)  <br>
              I worked in the fitting room helping customers with their immediate needs. Most of my time was spent out on the floor talking <br>
              to the customers and making sure they were happy and comfortable. I did spend a lot of time at the cash register checking customers <br>
              out and making sure their needs were met.
